Orders and Shipment Dashboard for an International E-Commerce Company
Importance of Orders and Shipment Dashboard
An orders dashboard is a tool that allows a company sales team to analyse their sales performance and understand where their revenue generations lie in terms of product categories, customer segments, regions etc across various years. This helps them to find a particular area where they should focus their sales and marketing efforts to see a better growth of their revenue.

A shipment dashboard, on the other hand, helps a company monitor their product shipments in terms of the products being shipped, order priority, ship mode, regions where shipments are made etc. This, in turn, helps them to understand their shipment backlogs, the kind of shipment orders they are receiving, where the shipments are going etc to aid in solidifying their supplies.

The Project:
In this project, I have created a dark-mode dashboard for an international e-commerce company to have a quick look at their orders and shipments across different years to allow them to adapt in order to reach their goals.

Metrics Visualised:
Total Revenue by Region
Total Revenue by Year
Revenue by Item Category
Revenue by Customer Segment
Shipments by Order Priority
Shipments by Ship Mode
The dashboard can be granulised further by:

Year
Customer Segment
Region
